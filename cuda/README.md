This directory contains placeholders and build scaffolding for custom CUDA kernels for the stereo matcher.

Structure created:
- kernels/: source .cu files (placeholders)
- include/: header files for kernels
- build/: helper scripts for Windows (PowerShell)

This is only scaffolding. No usable kernels are provided yet.

See `../README_cuda_setup.md` at repository root for next steps.
